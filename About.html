        <h3>Ancient Civilizations</h3>
        <p>
          The roots of South Africa's history can be traced back to ancient
          civilizations that flourished in the region. These early societies
          laid the groundwork for the cultural and social fabric that defines
          the country today. South Africa's first known inhabitants have been
          referred to as the Khoisan, the Khoekhoe and the San. Starting in
          about 1,000 BCE, these groups were then joined by people who migrated
          from Western and Central Africa during what is known as the Bantu
          expansion southwards through Africa.European exploration of the
          African coast began in the 13th century when Portugal sought an
          alternative route to the silk road to China. In the 14th and 15th
          century, Portuguese explorers traveled down the west African Coast,
          detailing and mapping the coastline and in 1488 they rounded the Cape
          of Good Hope.[3] The Dutch East India Company established a trading
          post in Cape Town under the command of Jan van Riebeeck in 1652,[4]
          European workers who settled at the Cape became known as the Free
          Burghers and gradually established farms in the Dutch Cape Colony.[5]
          Following the Invasion of the Cape Colony by the British in 1795 and
          1806, mass migrations collectively known as the Great Trek occurred
          during which the Voortrekkers established several Boer settlements on
          the interior of South Africa.[6] The discoveries of diamonds and gold
          in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the fortunes of the
          region, propelling it onto the world stage and introducing a shift
          away from an exclusively agrarian-based economy towards
          industrialisation and the development of urban infrastructure. The
          discoveries also led to new conflicts culminating in open warfare
          between the Boer settlers and the British Empire, fought essentially
          for control over the nascent South African mining industry. Following
          the defeat of the Boers in the Anglo–Boer or South African War
          (1899–1902), the Union of South Africa was created as a self-governing
          dominion of the British Empire on 31 May 1910 in terms of the South
          Africa Act 1909, which amalgamated the four previously separate
          British colonies: Cape Colony, Colony of Natal, Transvaal Colony, and
          Orange River Colony. The country became a fully sovereign nation state
          within the British Empire, in 1934 following enactment of the Status
          of the Union Act. The monarchy came to an end on 31 May 1961, replaced
          by a republic as the consequence of a 1960 referendum, which
          legitimised the country becoming the Republic of South Africa. From
          1948–1994, South African politics was dominated by Afrikaner
          nationalism. Racial segregation and white minority rule known
          officially as apartheid, an Afrikaans word meaning "separateness", was
          implemented in 1948. On 27 April 1994, after decades of passive
          resistance, armed struggle, and international opposition to apartheid,
          the first black party African National Congress (ANC) achieved victory
          in the country's first democratic election. Since then, the African
          National Congress has governed South Africa, in an alliance with the
          South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade
          Unions.

        <h5>Nelson Mandela</h5>

        </div>
        <p>
          Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South
          African anti-apartheid activist and politician who served as the first
          president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's
          first black head of state and the first elected in a fully
          representative democratic election. His government focused on
          dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial
          reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he
          served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party
          from 1991 to 1997. A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal
          family in Mvezo, South Africa. He studied law at the University of
          Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a
          lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and
          African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding
          its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only
          government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that
          privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its
          overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch,
          rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign
          and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for
          seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956
          Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned
          South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to
          non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the
          militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against
          the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and, following
          the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring
          to overthrow the state.

        <p>
          Desmond Mpilo Tutu Desmond Mpilo Tutu[1] OMSG CH GCStJ (7 October 1931
          – 26 December 2021) was a South African Anglican bishop and
          theologian, known for his work as an anti-apartheid and human rights
          activist. He was Bishop of Johannesburg from 1985 to 1986 and then
          Archbishop of Cape Town from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the
          first black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to
          fuse ideas from black theology with African theology. Tutu was born of
          mixed Xhosa and Motswana heritage to a poor family in Klerksdorp,
          South Africa. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married
          Nomalizo Leah Tutu, with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was
          ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom
          to study theology at King's College London. In 1966 he returned to
          southern Africa, teaching at the Federal Theological Seminary and then
          the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. In 1972, he became
          the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based
          in London but necessitating regular tours of the African continent.
          Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as dean of St Mary's
          Cathedral in Johannesburg and then as Bishop of Lesotho; from 1978 to
          1985 he was general-secretary of the South African Council of
          Churches. He emerged as one of the most prominent opponents of South
          Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation and white minority
          rule. Although warning the National Party government that anger at
          apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed
          non-violent protest and foreign economic pressure to bring about
          universal suffrage.

        <p>
          Albert John Luthuli[a] (c. 1898 – 21 July 1967) was a South African
          anti-apartheid activist, traditional leader, and politician who served
          as the President-General of the African National Congress from 1952
          until his death in 1967. Luthuli was born to a Zulu family in 1898 at
          a Seventh-day Adventist mission in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).
          In 1908 he moved to Groutville, where his parents and grandparents had
          lived, to attend school under the care of his uncle. After graduating
          from high school with a teaching degree, Luthuli became principal of a
          small school in Natal where he was the sole teacher. He accepted a
          government bursary to study for the Higher Teacher's Diploma at Adams
          College. After the completion of his studies in 1922, he accepted a
          teaching position at Adams College where he was one of the first
          African teachers. In 1928, he became the secretary of the Natal Native
          Teachers' Association, then its president in 1933.

        <p>
          Christiaan Neethling Barnard (8 November 1922 – 2 September 2001) was
          a South African cardiac surgeon who performed the world's first
          human-to-human heart transplant operation. On 3 December 1967, Barnard
          transplanted the heart of accident victim Denise Darvall into the
          chest of 54-year-old Louis Washkansky who regained full consciousness
          and was able to talk easily with his wife, before dying eighteen days
          later of pneumonia, largely brought on by the anti-rejection drugs
          that suppressed his immune system. Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs.
          Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, an
          assessment which has been criticised as misleading.Barnard's second
          transplant patient, Philip Blaiberg, whose operation was performed at
          the beginning of 1968, returned home from the hospital and lived for a
          year and a half.

                The Union of South Africa parliament enacts the Status of the

                of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, which removed the last
                vestiges of British legal authority over South Africa.
